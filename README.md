# Dragon Crew Members - Phase 1 Project


## Introduction
The Dragon Crew Member web application lets you sort the SpaceX crew members based on what agency they come from. This includes NASA, ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, Axiom Space, and SpaceX. This is accomplished by using `fetch()` and using the publicly available SpaceX API, https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/crew.

Choosing the agency in the select panel will return a the name and wikipedia link to each crew member within that agency, as well as their headshot.

The user will also have the option to set the page to "Dark Mode", which will change the style of the page to a night / dark setting.

Lastly, if a user is interested in seeing a crew member's photo more clearly, they can hover their mouse over any photo to increase it's size. Removing the mouse from the photo will set the photo back to it's original size.
